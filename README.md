- Trying my best to learn everything from Computer Science!

### My stack 🥞

- Python, because data 🤓☝️
- Terraform to setup infrastructure fast (and clean!)
- Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery and Redshift as my main Data Warehouses
- Docker and Kubernetes because containers are simply the best 📦
- SQL - I pronounce it like _squeal_

- Took part of an UAV aerodesign team in a competition context! (Yes, I know how to design and build an aircraft from scratch)

- I'm Brazilian
  -  🇧🇷🇧🇷 **OMG BRAZIL MENTIONED** 🇧🇷🇧🇷 

Some of the accomplishments that I'm proud of:

- Developed an aircraft optimizer based on genetic algorithms to maximize MTOW (max. take-off weight) in a competition environment
 -  Developed a low-res-high-performance CFD Software - [lltdrek](https://github.com/kuodrek/lltdrek), go see it!
 - Developed a [non-linear 6DOF flight simulator](https://github.com/kuodrek/albatrozflightdynamics) to check the flying qualities of aircrafts;
 - Feel free to contact me at kuodrek@gmail.com
