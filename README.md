<h1><p  align="center"> Hello, my name is Luis and I love coding and airplanes! üëç</p></h1>

- I'm passionate about data engineering and coding

- My main technologies: **Python, Apache Airflow, Docker, SQL, Linux and Git**

- I've worked with genetic algorithms to optimize aircrafts in the SAE Aerodesign competition!

I've built software projects like:

- Aircraft optimizer based on genetic algorithms to maximize MTOW (max. take-off weight)
 -  CFD Software using aerodynamic analysis to get coefficient forces and moments from a wing with any given planform;
 - Non-linear fully coupled flight simulator to check the flying qualities of an aircraft;
 - Many aircraft performance analysis tools.
